# coachUP ember api

This is the backend repository for my coachUP Ember application, which was built for General Assembly Boston's Web Development Immersive.

This API is built with the Express back end framework, connected to a SQL database via Sequelize. The architecture of the backend was generated with the November-CLI generator.
